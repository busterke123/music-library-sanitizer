# Epic 1 Retrospective - Run playlist enrichment safely (core CLI workflow)
Date: 2025-12-23

## Participants
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Arne.driesen (Project Lead)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)

## Epic Summary
- Scope: CLI scaffold, config loading, playlist resolution + preflight, progress + run summary, exit code semantics
- Delivery: 5/5 stories completed
- Quality focus: fail-closed error handling, typed errors, fixtures and E2E coverage for core behaviors

## What Went Well
- Smooth execution with clear scope and PRD alignment
- Stable CLI contract early, reducing drift across stories
- Strong test harness with fixtures and E2E checks

## Challenges and Risks
- Concern about partial-success behavior when track IDs are missing

## Decisions and Clarifications
- Missing track IDs are treated as per-track skipped outcomes (not fatal precondition failures)
- Exit codes map to outcomes: 0 for success, 1 for partial success, 2 for fail-closed precondition failure

## Action Items
- None identified

## Next Epic Preview (Epic 2)
- Focus: deterministic write planning, dry-run preview, idempotency rules, regeneration logic
- Dependencies: relies on Epic 1 CLI foundation, playlist preflight, summary counts, and exit codes

## Readiness Assessment
- Testing and quality: baseline checks in place for CLI behavior and error handling
- Deployment/release: local CLI use only; no production release gating identified
- Stakeholder acceptance: confirmed for Epic 1 outcomes
- Technical health: stable foundation for planning logic
- Blockers: none reported

## Significant Discoveries
- None that require changes to Epic 2 scope or architecture

## Commitments and Next Steps
- Proceed to Epic 2 planning when ready
- Maintain existing fail-closed and reporting conventions
