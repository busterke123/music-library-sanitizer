## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Clarify how to reconcile existing repo state (currently no `pyproject.toml`/`src/`) with the architecture target.
2. Should Improve: Add explicit acceptance commands (e.g., `uv run music-library-sanitzer --help`, `uv run pytest`).
3. Consider: Add a concrete expected file list output to populate the Dev Agent Record “File List”.
